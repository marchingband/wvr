# getting started

* On a computer, join the wifi network **WVR**, using the password **12345678**
* Open Google Chrome (or another browser which [implements the Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API)), navigate to the address http://192.168.5.18/, and the WVR UI will open

# powering wvr

* **wvr basic** : plug in usb, or apply 5v and ground, or 3.3v and ground, to the power pins
* **wvr makers board** : plug in usb (will not power amp), use a center-negative 9v PSU (Boss style) or apply somewhere between 6v and 9v (and ground) to the VIN pins
* **wvr dev board** : plug in usb, use a center-negative 9v PSU (Boss style) or apply somewhere between 6v and 9v and ground to the VIN pins
* **thames** : use a center-negative 9v PSU (Boss style)
* **usb host backpack** : The backpack is powered by the WVR, so if WVR is on, the backpack is also on. When updating firmware on the backpack, plug in the usb micro port on the backpack **instead of** powering the WVR. It has its 5v line connected to the WVR 5v pin. WVR takes this 5v line, passes it to the LDO, and passes 3.3v back to power the backpack. The 5v pin on the USB host port is also connected to the WVR 5v pin, so it can power whatever is plugged into it, adding some capacitance to meet the USB spec.

# updating firmware

* Create a folder on your computer where you will store firmwares for your WVR
* download your firmwares, saving them to this new folder
* navigate to :
https://github.com/marchingband/wvr_binaries
and find the folder for your board, download the .ino.bin file, which will be a link like:
https://github.com/marchingband/wvr_binaries/blob/main/wvr_basic/3.0.9/wvr_basic.ino.bin
Choose the newest binary (currently v3.9.0)
* Apply power to your WVR.
* On a computer, join the wifi network **WVR**, using the password **12345678**
* Open Google Chrome (or another browser which [implements the Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API)), navigate to the address http://192.168.5.18/, and the WVR UI will open
 >```note that starting with firmware version 3.9.0, the IP address of WVR has changed to 192.168.4.1```
* Click on **firmware** menu item at the top of the page
* Click **select binary** for **slot 0**, and in the file upload dialog select the firmware that you downloaded earlier
* To give the ninary a custom name, click the name of the binary at the left.
* Click **upload** for **slot 0**, and wait for the upload to complete
* Click **boot** for **slot 0**, and wait for the boot to complete. 
* Reset the WVR, rejoin the WVR wifi network, then reload the webpage.
* if you have a WVR with USB Host Backpack, you can follow these instructions to update the firmware on that : https://github.com/marchingband/wvr_usb_backpack

Congratulations! You now have the most up-to-date firmware loaded onto your WVR

# playing sounds

* in the WVR UI, click on a note ... maybe ... E2.
* now click **select file**
* a window will open, choose any sound file from your computer
* you can click **audition** and it will play on your computer speakers
* now click **pins** at the top. this is the pin configuration page
* click on **D2**
* on the left, you will see the options for that pin.
* set the **note** to **E2 (40)**
* set the **edge** to **falling** (this means that it will trigger notes when the pin goes from high to low, when you ground it. All the pins which have pullups have them turned on by default, so grounding the pins is like pressing a key on a piano. Setting the edge is important, the default setting is **none** so no sounds will be triggered by this pin until it is changed.
* set the debounce time : If you are manually grounding the pin with a wire use 120ms, if you have a mechanical button 60ms is good, if you are using an external micro-controller, you could use 0ms. If you get multiple triggers, and multiple sounds playing when you ground a pin, raise the debounce time :) Google "mcu debounce" if you want to learn more about this.
* you will notice that some pins have a touch/digital option. This makes the pins touch sensitive. The same logic applies with the edge : touching the pin with a finger causes a falling edge, and 60ms is a great starting point for a debounce time. The WVR calibrates itself for capacitive touch everytime it is reset, so, it is important to have your hands away from the WVR when you reset it, so it can do an accurate calibration. If it seems off, just reset the WVR and keep your hands clear for a few seconds.
* if you click on **action** you can see all the possible ways to use these pin events. It can trigger a sound, but it can also do many other things.
* **velocity** is the Midi term for volume, so, set this to the playback volume that you would like to result from events on this pin.
* wait for the sync to complete. You will see your pin configs have updated, and your sounds are displayed in the sounds menu. Now when you press **audition** the sound will not play in the browser, it will play on the WVR.
* connect headphones or some line out to the WVR
* using a wire (or a female jumper cable) connect the **GND** pin on the WVR to pin **D2**, and your sound should play.
* note that WVR does not have an on-board amplifier. The output is line level. Most headphones will actually work ok, although there may be some distortion. In order to connect a speaker, you will need an amplifier of some kind. A bluetooth speaker with a line-in is a great way to play with WVR when getting started.

![wvr gui](https://github.com/marchingband/wvr_hardware/blob/main/images/gui_pins.png)

# midi control
WVR will respond to the following midi events:  
Note on  
Note off  
Program Change  
Pitch Bend
CC 7 (volume)  
CC 10 (panning)  
CC 11 (expression)  
CC 64 (sustain, like the pedal on a piano)  
CC 72 (release time (up to ~30ms fade out))  
CC 73 (attack time (up to ~30ms fade out))  
CC 120 (all sound off)  
CC 121 (reset all controllers)  
Note that volume, panning and expression, like velocity, will respond acording to a particular sounds response curve. A sound with Inverse Square Root response curve selected will pan with that same algorythm applied.
  
You can also send some 1-byte SYSEX commands for global controls, currently:  
0x01 = WiFi on  
0x02 = WiFi off. 
  
So a sysex file to turn off wifi would look like "F0 02 F7". (F0 and F7 are the SYSEX start and end bytes)  

# web midi
The WVR Web UI can act as a MIDI destination for your DAW or other MIDI applications, and in turn send MIDI data over Wifi to WVR. Using this technique you can play your WVR wirelessly.  
On macos, open Audio MIDI Setup, open the MIDI Studio panel, double click the IAC Driver to open its preferences, and check the **Device is online** box.  
In your DAW's preferences, make the IAC Driver a midi output. Select the IAC Driver as the MIDI destination for your midi track.  
Google Chrome currently considers Web MIDI to be a "powerful feature" and so access is limited to HTTPS websites. Since ESP32 cannot serve over HTTPS, we need to ask Google Chrome to make an exception and trust the WVR.  
In Google Chrome, enter **chrome://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure** into the url bar, add **http://192.168.5.18** to the list, click **enable**, and then restart Google Chrome.

 >```note that starting with firmware version 3.9.0, the IP address of WVR has changed to 192.168.4.1```

Now in the WVR Web UI, in the Global Screen (click the **WVR** button top and center), click the **Refresh** button at the bottom of the screen, under **Web MIDI**, and make sure the IAC Driver is listed to the right.  
Your DAW should now stream MIDI data wirelessly to WVR.

![wvr gui](https://github.com/marchingband/wvr_hardware/blob/main/images/gui_global.png)

# understanding priority
WVR can playback up to 18 stereo sounds at once. It mixes all the sounds into a stereo output. If you play very fast, or play dense chords, or have very long sounds, it's possible to ask the WVR to play back more then 18 sounds. When this happens, WVR runs an algorithm to figure out what to do. It will try to find an old, or an unimportant sound, stop playing that sound, and play the newly triggered sound instead. You can help it make this decision by giving some sounds higher **priority**. A lower priority sound will never stop a higher priority sound, only equal or lower priority. In the case where all 18 voices are busy playing high priority sounds, and a lower priority sound is triggered, WVR will not play the sound.

# understanding exclusive group
**Exclusive Group** allows you to tell WVR that only one member out of a group of notes can be playing at one time. If you want your open hihat sample to stop when a closed hihat sample starts, or if you want one bass note to stop when another starts, you can achieve this by setting the **exclusive group** value of all the notes in that group to the same number ie. add them all to the same exclusive group. These groups work across voices and channels. When a note-on is received on a memeber of an exclusive group, any other note in that group that is playing will be immidiately stopped. You can also use this functionality to stop notes in the **exclusive group** without triggering a new sound, just use a note with no sound in the slot. In the case of pause/resume (and related) modes, this will allow you to restart a sample from the beginning. As with all the note settings, you can select multiple notes using shift-click or command-click, and change the exclusive group for all selected notes.

# understanding playback mode
* A *one-shot* sample will play once and stop.  
* A *loop* sample will loop precisely, so trim the sample carefully to avoid pops. It will continue until it receives a note-off and then immidiately stop.  
* An *ASR-loop* sample will start at the beginning of the sample, play until loop-end, then loop between loop-start and loop-end until it receives a note off, at which time it will play from its current position, past the loop-end, to the end of the sample (if the note-off meaning is set to **release**), or immidiately stop (if the note-off meaning is set to 
**halt**). Choose the loop-start and loop-end carefully to avoid pops. The numbers you enter into loop-start and loop-end are expressed in *samples*. These are channel samples, and WVR converts all samples to stereo, so in your DAW, when measuring and calculating these points, you may need to half or double the number, depending on if your original sample is stereo or mono, and depending on how your DAW measures sample positions. The points are shown in the waveform view as golden vertical lines, but only the first time you load a sample. When you return to modify these points after a sync, the waveform is no longer loaded, so these points wont be displayed.  
* A *pause/resume* sample will pause when it receives a note-off message, and resume from the same position when it receives the next note-on. You can reset the sample to the beginning by triggering a sample (or an empty note) with the same exclusive group.  
* A *pause/loop* and a *pause/asr* sample behave exactly like *pause/resume* but with respect to loop and ASR-loop modes, respectively.

# understanding response curve
Every MIDI note has a velocity (or volume) attached to it. This is a value from 0 to 127. Imagine a graph with these 127 velocities on the y axis, and the playback volume that each actually triggers on the x axis. If this is a straight line, we have a **linear** response curve. Many people find other curves to be more human, or more musical. The default response curve for WVR is the **Square Root** algorithm, but you can also choose **linear** or **logarithmic**.

# understanding retrigger mode
If a sound is triggered a second time, at a time when it is already in playback, this is a "retrigger". WVR can respond to this event in a number of ways. It can respond by stopping the sound (note-off), restarting the sound from the beginning (restart), ignoring the second trigger (ignore) or by starting a new playback of the same sound without stopping the first (retrigger). In the case of **note-off**, WVR will respect this event even if **note-off** is set to **ignore**, which creates a way to use note-on events to toggle playback. The first note-on will start a sample, the next will stop it (or in the case of pasue/resume mode, they will pause and resume the note).

# understanding note off
When a key is lifted on a piano, and likewise, when a pin on the WVR moves from a LOW back to a HIGH state, a "note-off" event is triggered. You can opt to ignore these events by choosing the "ignore" setting, or you can choose to observe them by selecting the "halt" setting, in which case the sound will fade out very fast, and stop, when the note-off event for that sound occurs. In the case of ASR-LOOP mode, you have the additional **release** option. Selecting **release** means that the sample will play-out to the end, whereas the **halt** option will cause the sample to immidiately stop.

# using racks
The term "rack" is our word for multi-sample functionality. With a traditional midi instrument, the sound engine responds to velocity data by modulating the **volume** of the sounds it produces. In a multi-sampled instrument, instead, the engine responds to velocity by playing a different sample, presumably a sample that reflects a lighter or heavier touch. In the case of a drum sample, the engine should have samples of the same drum being struck with various amounts of force, for example. To create a rack for a given note, click **create rack** in the UI. Next it's a good idea to name this rack, so hit **name rack** and enter a name. You should have all your samples prepared in advance, so next, hit **number of layers** and let WVR know how many samples you have for this rack. Be careful because changing this number in the future clears the data. The UI will automatically set "break points" evenly for each sample, but you can click any layer, and modify the break point if you like. The formula "< 50" you see in the UI indicates that this is the sample that will be triggered if the velocity is below 50, but above the break point for the previous layer. In other words this number sets the upper bound for this layer. You can still use FX while in Rack mode, but the same FX will be applied to all the layers.

# bulk uploading files
You can use **shift-click** and **command-click** to select regions of notes (and regions of racks), or ctrl+a to select all notes. If you click **select files** while a range is selected, then the file dialog that comes up will allow you to select multiple files. The files you select will be sorted alphanumerically, and placed in order into the notes you have selected.

# bulk uploading racks 
If you **shift-click** on **select files** while a region of notes are selected, a special file upload dialog will appear, which allows you to select a **directory**. This function allows you to bulk upload some racks. The structure of the folder that you select must be organized in a very specific way. It must be a folder of sub-folders. Each subfolder represents a rack, and contains all the files for that rack. It will use the name of the subfolder for the name of the rack, and it will create as many slots as there are files. It will then sort all the folders, and all the files in all the folders alphanumerically, and place them into racks in the notes that you have selected. If any of these directories contain only one file, then a rack will not be created, it will load as a normal single sample, and if the directory contains only a single file called empty.txt, then this note will remain empty.

# save and load voice configuration
If you **shift-click** on a voice button (numbered 1-16 at the top on the home screen) a dialog will open that will let you download a .json file, this file represents all the config settings for that voice. You can rename it as you like with the .json suffix, and save it to your computer. If you **shift-alt-click** on the voice button, a dialog will open, where you can select a previously saved .json file to now load up all those config settings into that voice.

# pitch interpolation
If you select a range of notes, and then **shift-alt-click** a note, the note will turn red, and it becomes the **pitch interpolation target**. Click **select file** and select one file from the dialog. The selected file will be pitch interpolated across the range you have selected. The **pitch interpolation target** will maintain its pitch, and all the other notes you selected will be pitched up or down in relation to it. You can look at the **FX** tab to see how the algorithm has decided to pitch your notes.

# pitch interpolating a rack
If you follow the steps above for pitch interpolation, but instead of selecting a single file, you instead select multiple files in the dialog, then the selected files will be sorted alphanumerically, and made into a rack, that rack will then be copied to all selected notes, and pitch shifted just like in pitch interpolation.

# pitch interpolating an ASR loop
When using pitch interpolation with an ASR Loop sample, the Start and End values also need to be interpolated, because the file size, and all the samples in the sound, will scale according to the pitch, so the sample position of the loop points will also need to be scaled.
If you use **shift-click** and **shift-alt-click** to select a range and an interpolation target, you are able to intepolate the loopStart and loopEnd configuration values. Enter the Start and End values for the target sample, and the other notes in the selected range will automatically receive interpolated values based on their relationship to the interpolation target.

# using fx
WVR uses the web browsers built-in audio engine to do a lot of work preparing samples before it sends audio data to the WVR. It converts any sample that you choose to a standard audio format of 44.1k 16bit stereo PCM. It also adds FX. Currently the WVR UI implements Distortion, Reverb, Pitch Shift, Panning, Reverse and Volume. These FX are rendered before being sent to WVR, so the processor on WVR doesn't need to do any extra signal processing. This does mean that the reverb and it's tail are hard coded into the sample. If you have a sample with reverb, you must set up the note to ignore note-off events, otherwise there will not be a reverb tail if the note off event occurs before the sound is finished playing. You cannot return to the UI later and modify the FX settings, after you have SYNC'd the data to WVR. To change the FX you would need to select the original sound file again from your computer, apply the FX in a new way, and hit SYNC again. Click **audition** to hear how the FX sound. Depending on your computer and web browser, this rendering process is sometimes buggy, it may freeze for a moment (or a few seconds) before playback begins.

# global settings
In the UI, click the blue **WVR** button top and center of the screen. This is the **Global Settings** menu.
* **global volume** sets the overall volume of the WVR output. A value of 127 mean full volume, and 0 means mute.
* WVR has a **recovery mode** functionality that you can set up here. If you hold the **recovery pin** to ground and push reset on WVR, code will stop executing, and a special **recovery mode** UI will be served. This means that you can experiment with firmwares, and always have a fallback incase there is an error in your code that may prevent you from accessing the UI. Just make sure that wvr.begin() is called before your custom code.
* If you open the javascript console in your web browser, you will see some logs coming from the WVR. You can set the **log verbosity**. If you don't need logs, leave it set to **none**. Verbose logs can cause little glitches in the audio engine.
* **wifi on at boot** determines weather your WVR will turn on its wifi antenna at boot. Setting this to **false** is risky. Make sure that you have a pin action set to turn it on, and have tested that pin, because if you don't, its possible you will be unable to access the UI to change this setting back! The solution could be to boot into recovery mode, of course, should that occur.
* you can also change the WIFI network name and password here.
* **wifi power** allows you to change how strong the wifi signal is. Higher numbers mean more range, which also draws more power, creating more heat. At **8** the range should fill a room.
* **midi channel** sets what MIDI channels WVR listens to, ***OMNI*** means it will listen on all 16 channels.
* **pitch bend up** and **pitch bend down** allow you to set the range of your pitch bending, measured in semi-tones. Setting this to 2 means it will bend up/down one whole tone, while setting the ***down*** range to 12 will mean you can bend down one octave.
* WVR has memory dedicated to store up to 128 racks. **rack slots remaining** lets you keep track of how many are free.
* Backing up and restoring your eMMC (onboard memory on the WVR) is meant for cloning your WVR, in the case where you have a product that you want to quickly clone, and not have to set up all the configuration and sounds every time. **backup eMMC** will upload a binary file to your computer. On the receiving device, open this same menu and **select eMMC recovery file** then **restore eMMC**. This process may take a long time, depending on how many sounds you have in memory. Note this process will clone everything *except* the firmware running on your WVR, so make sure you have the same (or compatible) firmwares running on both devices. All the note configurations, all the sounds, the backup firmware, your stored firmwares, the global settings, and everything else will be cloned to the new WVR! After a successful restore process, always reset the WVR, and then refresh the borowser to see all the changes.
* If you want to reset the memory on your WVR, you can click **reset eMMC**. All sounds, configuration, and firmwares will be deleted, but the firmware currently loaded will remain in flash, and will continue to run.
* You can upload a firmware directly to the ESP32 flash, and boot it, without using the **firmware** menu, by clicking **select firmware**, choosing a binary, and then clicking **force uplad**. This binary will not be stored in eMMC memory, so it will not appear in the **firmware** menu. It will stay in flash, and continue to run until a new firmware is force-uploaded, or until another firmware is selected from the **firmware** tab.  
* **join external wifi network** will cause WVR to attempt to join a local WiFi nertwork. Set the drop-down to **yes** and fill out the network name and password, then click **try new network and password**. After a few seconds, click on **get IP Address**, and if the WVR was successfull in joining the network, an IP address will be displayed. Copy this address. You can now connect your computer to the local WiFi network, and access the WVR UI by pasting the IP address into your browser address bar. WVR will save the network and password, and automatically try to join it, at boot, as long as this setting is set to **yes**. Occasionally, your router may decide to assign a new IP address to the WVR, in which case you will have to repeat the process, to get the new IP.

# firmware manager
WVR can store up to 10 different firmwares, and the UI allows you to boot from any of them.
Click **select binary** for the slot you want to use, and find the compiled binary on your computer. Click on the filename (at the left) and rename your firmware so you know what it is. Click **upload** and wait for it to complete. After refreshing the browser, click **boot** and wait for the firmware to boot. It's a good idea to reset the WVR after this process, then refresh the browser. You are now in your new firmware! Note that some firmwares are not compatible. If the partition scheme on the eMMC is different between firmwares, the WVR will notice, and will have to reformat the eMMC, this means you will loose all stored configuration and sounds, and all your firmwares, etc. Releases of WVR firmware are versioned to make this clear. 1.0.1 -> 1.0.2 or 1.1.1 is safe, but 1.0.1 -> 2.0.1 would not be safe. We will aim to only VERY RARELY make a major version bump, but there may be times when it is necessary. Other developers who may release their own WVR firmwares in the future SHOULD CERTAINLY follow this tradition, and indicate which version of WVR firmware they are targeting :) <3

# setting up for Arduino IDE programming

!!!WARNING!!!  
Do not upload your own custom code to WVR without a working USB-FTDI module setup (see below). If your binary has a bug, it will prevent WiFi from launching, and you will be unable to upload a working binary. Your WVR will be bricked until you obtain a USB-FTDI module.  
  
  Once you have your FTDI working, here are the steps to setup Arduino for WVR programming!  
* install the latest Arduino IDE
* follow instructions online to install the ESP32 stuff : https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32
* In the Arduino Boards manager, when you install the ESP32 board, please select version 2.0.8.
* donwload the WVR Arduino library here https://github.com/marchingband/wvr/releases/tag/v3.9.0
* create a folder called **libries** in your Arduino sketch folder and unzip the **WVR Arduino library** into that folder, so it should be Arduino/libraries/WVR/...
* using the Arduino library manager, install **ADAFRUIT NEOPIXEL**
* download https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer and https://github.com/me-no-dev/AsyncTCP (click **CODE** -> **download zip**) and then unzip them into the **libraries** folder as well.
* we also recommend you install **ESP Exception Decoder**, in case you want to decode stack traces from the serial monitor, during your Arduino development
* restart Arduino IDE
* go to file->examples, and under **WVR**, open **wvr_basic**
* select the **ESP32 Wrover Module** in the boards menu
* click file->save_as and save this as a new sketch (rename it if you like)
* click **sketch->export compiled binary**, the file will be saved in your new sketch's folder in the newly created **build** folder
* join the **WVR** wifi network, open the WVR UI at http://192.168.5.18/

 >```note that starting with firmware version 3.9.0, the IP address of WVR has changed to 192.168.4.1```

* click **firmware** and then choose a new slot, hit **select binary** for that slot, and choose your .bin file from the your_sketch/build folder, in the UI, click the file name and choose a new name for this firmware, so you can keep track of your custom binaries, silly Arduino will always default to the same binary name.
* click **upload**, then click **boot** when upload is complete

Congratulations! You have flashed a custom firmware to your WVR!

# using Arduino CLI
* install the Arduino CLI
* in a fresh terminal use the command ```arduino-cli compile -e --build-property build.code_debug=2 --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32wrover wvr_basic``` but use your sketch name in place of ```wvr_basic```
* join the **WVR** wifi network
* to flash, you can use curl, the command ```curl --data-binary "@/Users/Username/Documents/Arduino/wvr_basic/build/esp32.esp32.esp32wrover/wvr_basic.ino.bin" http://192.168.5.18/update --header "content-type:text/plain"``` will work, if you change the paths to point at your binary in the build folder within your sketch folder

 >```note that starting with firmware version 3.9.0, the IP address of WVR has changed to 192.168.4.1```

* in the WVR Arduino library, look at the file ```wvr.sh``` to find some other ideas for things you can do with the arduino-cli, you can modify this bash script to work for you if you like!

# using platformIO

setup your platformio.ini file like this:
```
[env:esp-wrover-kit]
platform = espressif32@6.2.0
framework = arduino
board = esp-wrover-kit
lib_deps =
    https://github.com/marchingband/wvr.git
    # https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer.git
    # https://github.com/me-no-dev/AsyncTCP.git
build_flags = -DBOARD_HAS_PSRAM -mfix-esp32-psram-cache-issue
monitor_speed = 115200
# upload_port = /dev/cu.usbserial-A50285BI
```  
  
Create a `main.cpp` and copy one of the example files into it. Remember to add `#include <Arduino.h>` at the top of `main.cpp`.  
  
# using FTDI  
You will need something like this: https://www.adafruit.com/product/3309  
To connect a usb->fdti module to your WVR, connect **D0** to **TX**, **D1** to **RX**, and **GND** to **GND**. Open the sketch examples/wvr_ftdi, where you will see ```wvr->useFTDI = true```. The ESP32 on the WVR needs to be booted into a special FTDI boot mode, to do this, ground **D6** and ground the small copper pad on the top of the WVR labeled "TP1" (it's right next to the eMMC), and hit reset. You can release D6 and the boot pad now. The ESP32 is now in FTDI boot mode, and if you have a serial monitor attached the WVR, it should print ```waiting for download```. Now you can use the **UPLOAD** button in the Arduin IDE, at the end of flashing it will print "hard resetting", now restart the WVR. If you open the Arduino Serial Console, you will see some logs form the WVR boot process. With FTDI, you can also use ```./wvr.sh ftdi``` to flash, and Arduino Serial Monitor (or any Serial monitor app you like) to get logs from WVR

# hardware considerations  
* **Pin D6** is a "strapping pin" for the ESP32, it corresponds to **GPIO_0** on the ESP32. This is a feature of ESP32 which **cannot be disabled**. If **D6** is held **LOW** at boot by external circuitry, the ESP32 will enter bootloader mode, and the firmware will not run, it will wait for upload until reset.  
* **Pins D6** and **D13** (**A0** and **A7**) are connected to **ADC peripheral 2**, which is shared with the WiFi radio. ADC readings on these pins will be inconsistent when made at a time when the WiFi radio is active. All the other Analog Input pins are attached to **ADC 1**, and are fine to use when WiFi is active.  
* **D7 D8 D9** and **D10** are input only pins (so calling `digitalWrite()` on these pins will have no effect). These pins do not have internal pullups available. This is a feature missing from the ESP32, so design your hardware with external pullups when needed.
